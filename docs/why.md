## Why do we need better privacy in bitcoin?

Greg Maxwell explains it well in his proposal for Confidential Transactions [3]:

> Insufficient financial privacy can have serious security and privacy
> implications for both commercial and personal transactions. Without
> adequate protection, thieves and scammers can focus their efforts on
> known high-value targets, competitors can learn business details, and
> negotiating positions can be undermined. Since publishing often requires
> spending money, lack of privacy can chill free speech.  Insufficient
> privacy can also result in a loss of fungibility--where some coins are
> treated as more acceptable than others--which would further undermine
> Bitcoin's utility as money.
> 
> Bitcoin partially addresses the privacy problem by using pseudonymous
> addresses. If someone does not know which users own which addresses,
> the privacy impact is reduced. But any time you transact with someone
> you learn at least one of their addresses. From there, you can trace out
> other connected addresses and estimate the values of their transactions
> and holdings. For example, suppose your employer pays you with Bitcoin
> and you later spend those coins on your rent and groceries. Your landlord
> and the supermarket will both learn your income, and could charge you
> higher prices as your income changes or target you for theft.
